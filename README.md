0x1D. C - Binary trees

This was a project in which I learnt about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. I learned about how to
qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I
implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
